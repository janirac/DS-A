// Write a method, digital_root(num). It should sum the digits of a positive integer. 
// If it is greater than or equal to 10, sum the digits of the resulting number. 
// Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the "digital root". 
// Do not use string conversion within your method.

// Slowed down, think a little more. Spend more time understanding the problem and asking questions
// Talk about your understanding of the problem and reitterate the question
// Base case scenerio
